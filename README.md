# Wonderful Weather
------------------

An android application built in kotlin to grab weather from an [api](http://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/TOP/31,80/forecast) and display the data in a scrollable list.

## Technologies
----------------
This app uses weather.gov for weather data, runs on kotlin and android, and utilizes google material design libraries along with RecyclerView to beautifuly display the next 10 days forecasts.

## Personal Thoughts
---------------
Before getting started on this app, I had zero experience with Kotlin. I used the [Google Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/courses) course as my crash course for android development. I completed the application in 6 hours, and the Google courses took me a week.
Coming from Javascript, I struggled with using the retrofit library to grab and parse JSON data. Unlike Javascript, Kotlin requires several more steps to grab and parse web data.
 
My javascript background helped me a lot with this project. Javascript taught me basic programming logic and ways of thinking. While learning Kotlin, I could apply my javascript knowledge and focus on the differences in how the two languages operate. This comparison allowed me to identify and understand the ins and outs of android development. Creating layouts through XML and the design editor is almost second nature now. I recommend this project for anyone who wants to begin their Kotlin android devolopment journey.
